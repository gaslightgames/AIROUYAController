AIROUYAController
=================

AIROUYAController is an unofficial Native Extension for Adobe AIR designed to expose the functionalities of the OUYA Controller to ActionScript 3.

This Extension is in HEAVY development, is constantly being updated and modified.  It is not exactly "stable" nor ready for commercial use.  Use with caution and be aware of problems, changes etc!

Folder Structure
================

There are 3 folders within the project:
1) OUYAControllerANEJava
The Native Java code.
2) OUYAControllerANELib
The ActionScript 3 Interface code.  Generates a SWC.
3) OUYAControllerANETest
A simple application that implements the ANE
4) OUYAControllerANEDefaultLib
Creates the "default" SWC.  This mimics the functionality of the ANE for unsupported platforms.
5) OUYAControllerWindowsTest
Demonstrates that any AIR application can have the ANE attached, now that the default platform is included.

Current Progress
================

All buttons work (except the OUYA Button - this is an outside case)
All Sticks work (some noise, in that 0.0 on the axis is sent often! - FIXED!)
Both Triggers work

To-Do
=====

* Build base ANE [DONE]
* Include OuyaController library [DONE]
* Extract .class files from OuyaController and embed into ANE (at JAR level) [DONE - must be done on ever new JAR!]
* Send Events for Buttons [DONE]
* Send Events for Thumbsticks [DONE]
* Send Events for Triggers [DONE]
* Create Repo on github [DONE]
* Multiple Controller Support [DONE]
* Touchpad Support [DONE - limitation: Touchpad acts as mouse, so the OuyaController has no "Player" value for whom used the trackpad]
* Fix Deadzone issue with Thumbsticks [DONE]
* Add OUYA Button [DONE - although we cannot intercept this!  The button support is in for when we may be able to find a workaround]
* Add isControllerSupported method [DONE - We use "isControllerSupported" instead of "isSupported" because if you use multiple ANEs and if these ANEs share any method names, whichever was the last loaded will use the name.]
* Add "default" platform [DONE - allows us to use the ANE in the same application for multiple platforms]
